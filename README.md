## Overview
***
Overall, the goal of this review was to determine the number of employees upcoming for retirement & those employees who maybe be eligible for a mentorship program. The goal is to ensure that the remaining employees, post the "Silver Tsunami" are ready to take the reigns. 
## Results

The analysis was broken down into a few steps: 

- First it was important to determine which employees are approaching retirement, the results of that are in the 'retirement titles' csv. Screen shot below: 

- Second, it was important to determine what each employees most recent title is to better understand seniority, the results of that are in the 'unique titles' csv. Screen shot below. 

- Third, it was important to determine the count of each active employees titles, to better determine the impact at retirement, the result fos that are in the 'retiring titles' csv. Screen shot below: 

- Forth, it was important to create a list of employees that were eligible to mentor more junior employees, results of that list in the 'mentorship eligibility' csv file. Screen shot below. 

## Summary 
***
The results of this analysis were quite shocking. HP needs to prepare for the upcoming retirement wave, by ensuring they understand the employees approaching retirement, and have enough qualified people to train the up and coming employees. 

- Overall HP has 72,458 employees approaching retirement who's rolls will need to be filled. 
- From a mentorship standpoint there are 1,549 employees that are eligible for mentorship. 

These figures suggest that each mentor would have to train roughly 7 employees each to fill the gap from retiring employees, this is a tall order. As a result I would suggest the company conduct mentorship programs, but also enact various training programs in addition to mentorship which can train large numbers of employees at a time. Without this, the company might have a large knowledge base leave that they cant fill.
